Pet Keepers offers a platform dedicated to providing pet services through the internet, utilizing geographic proximity. Users can contact each other through the chat we provide and can organize the type of service they want to receive or provide, as well as establish the time and price.

Each user will be able to create a profile, in which, depending on whether they offer or request a service, they will have a rating from others.
